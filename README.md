Exploratory Findings for the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite


KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite site:  http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php


### Images

There are four sets of images:
- left color images of object data set (12 GB)
- right color images, if you want to use stereo information (12 GB)
- the 3 temporally preceding frames (left color) (36 GB)
- the 3 temporally preceding frames (right color) (36 GB)

Each is comprised of training and testing sets.  The training set has 7,480 images, while the testing
set has 7,517 images.  Because of the amount of disk space these images consume, we are not able to
include them all in this repository.  They can be downloaded from
http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php.

Please see image samples [here](images.md). The image files are in the [images](./images)
directory.

#### Dimensions

The images appear to have varying dimensions.  However, dimensions for a single scene (left, right,
3 previous left, 3 previous right) are consistent. A quick sampling of images provided the following
dimensions (in pixels):
- 000189.png: 1224 x 370
- 000274.png: 1242 x 375
- 001603.png: 1241 x 376
- 001822.png: 1238 x 374




#### Labels

Labels for the training set can be found in the
[zip_files](https://github.com/bostondidi/kitti/tree/master/zip_files) directory.  A sample is
provided with an image sample at [here](images.md#labels).
